# Notes

#### Candidate Name: Daniel Ciao

#### Tasks and time spent:

- Task 1 - I spent about 1hr clean up the original project structure and set it up correctly, then about 1.5hr styling and writing up tests. I feel like I want to do more with styling the chart though. Most of my time was spent on reading Recharts API docs.
- Task 3 - This was relatively easy. I already had the structures set up. I wrote a few test cases for it, made sure the function worked as I expected and then just used it in the app. About 45mins. This morning I thought about an edge case, so it's approximately another15mins to cover that.

#### Notes:

I thoroughly enjoyed this exercise. I would like to spend more time on styling though. I could have added a nice loader and maybe make it more responsive if I had more time. But then again, I can see myself spending hours on prefecting it. lol Yes... As you can see, I had a lot of fun. :)
